    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a few years now I&rsquo;ve used David Seah&rsquo;s excellent
<a href="http://davidseah.com/productivity-tools">Printable CEO</a> resources, to keep
track of my activity across projects. I stopped doing it a while back for some
reason, but recently rediscovered them, and decided they deserved a mention,
particularly the
<a href="http://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/">Emergent Task Planner(ETP)</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0Z0Y0V3Q1i3g0l1i1i3O/ClouDrop%20Dec%204,%202012,%2012:37:35%20AM.png" alt="ETP top section" /></p>

<p>The ETP really is great to use, and the pads you can buy from Amazon are of
extremely high quality. What I like most is how much it reduces the friction of
plotting how I&rsquo;ve spent my day. It&rsquo;s dead simple to just pick up and start
using. I have found the ETP to be an <em>invaluable</em> asset for logging of how
I spend my time between different projects.</p>

<p>A word of caution: the ScanTron-phobic among us may wish to look elsewhere for
suitable productivity tools, as the filling in of little ovals features
prominently in these. But for the frictionless capturing of task-based
information in the moment, I haven&rsquo;t found anything else that works nearly as
well for me.</p>
