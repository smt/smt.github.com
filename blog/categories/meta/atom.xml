    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To those who tried to visit this site only to get a 404 error in the
last 24 hours, I apologize. I believe DNS propagation was the culprit,
and I jumped the gun by announcing that my post was up. I was able to
view stephentudor.com just fine, but quickly found that several people,
including my lovely wife, could not even get to the site initially.</p>

<p>By this time, it appears that most folks have been able to access it. If
you can see this post, you&rsquo;re fine. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re probably in the
camp that is left wondering why <a href="//twitter.com/tudorstudio/status/89876273408655360">this joker posted a 404 URL to Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Again, mea culpa. I&rsquo;ll know better next time :)</p>
